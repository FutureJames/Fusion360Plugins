McMasterCarr BOM.py

This Utility Add-in will allow you to export a BOM (Bill of Materials) of all McMaster-Carr components you have imported into your project.  It will count each instance and generate a list that you can copy and paste directly into the McMaster.com cart for a one click order.

Install and run from the Fusion360 Utilities -> AddIns menu.  Copy the results from the window that pops up.
